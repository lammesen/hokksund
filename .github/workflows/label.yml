# This workflow will triage pull requests and apply a label based on the
# paths that are modified in the pull request.
#
# To use this workflow, you will need to set up a .github/labeler.yml
# file with configuration.  For more information, see:
# https://github.com/actions/labeler

name: Labeler
# We use `pull_request_target` instead of `pull_request` because the labeler action requires write permissions to apply labels to PRs.
# This workflow does NOT check out or execute any code from the PR, so it is safe to use `pull_request_target`.
